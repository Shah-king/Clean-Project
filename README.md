# ProjectClean
Campus Issue Reporting Platform

**Motivation:**
College campuses often face recurring issues with cleanliness, maintenance, and facilities that go unreported or unresolved due to the lack of an accessible reporting system. Students and professors may encounter broken equipment, dirty restrooms, or unclean classrooms but have no structured way to notify responsible staff. ProjectClean aims to bridge this communication gap by allowing users to quickly report issues in real-time, improving campus hygiene, safety, and overall satisfaction.

**Project Description:**
ProjectClean is a responsive web application designed for students and faculty members to report facility-related problems directly to campus janitorial or maintenance staff. Users can log in using their student or faculty credentials and submit reports that include:
	•	Type of issue (e.g., Cleaning, Maintenance, Safety)
	•	Description/message
	•	Location (e.g., “W330”, “West Stairs”, “North 3rd floor men’s bathroom”)
	•	Optional media upload (photo or video)

The platform will then route the issue to the appropriate department (e.g., janitors, building maintenance) for resolution. A simple dashboard for staff will allow them to view, prioritize, and mark reports as resolved.

**Development Stack:**
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap or Tailwind), JavaScript (React.js)
	•	Backend: Node.js with Express
	•	Database: MongoDB (for storing users, issues, media paths)
	•	Authentication: JWT or Firebase Authentication
	•	Media Storage: Cloudinary or local storage for image/video uploads
	•	Version Control: Git & GitHub (individual contributions tracked)

**Tasks:**
Task 1 - Project planning, user flow design, team role assignments
Task 2 - Set up GitHub repo, basic frontend (login, report form)
Task 3 - Backend setup: user auth, issue submission routes
Task 4 - Media upload integration, location tagging, staff dashboard
Task 5 - Final features: issue tracking status, email notifications
Task 6 - Testing, responsiveness, bug fixing, deployment
Task 7 - Final presentation preparation, user documentation

**Value:**
ProjectClean provides an intuitive, real-world tool for improving campus life by making issue reporting simple and effective. It empowers users to take part in maintaining a cleaner and safer environment, while helping campus staff manage and address problems more efficiently.
